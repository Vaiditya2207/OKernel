## 2024-05-18 - PathBuf::join Overwrite in Aether File Upload
Vulnerability Pattern: Arbitrary File Write via absolute path injection in `multipart.next_field().file_name()`.
Systemic Cause: The `upload_handler` blindly trusts the `filename` provided in the HTTP multipart request without sanitization. In Rust, `PathBuf::join` completely replaces the base path if the appended string is an absolute path, leading to out-of-bounds file writes.
Auditor Note: Always check usages of `PathBuf::join` with user-supplied strings, especially those extracted from multipart uploads, headers, or query parameters. Look for missing sanitization of path separators and absolute paths before path concatenation.

## 2024-05-18 - Weak Default Fallback for Authentication Keys
Vulnerability Pattern: Broken Auth via fallback to a weak default credential using `unwrap_or_else` on an environment variable.
Systemic Cause: To prevent crashes during local testing, sensitive environment variables like API keys are given default hardcoded string fallbacks in the application logic. When deployed to production without these variables explicitly set, the system silently relies on the insecure defaults.
Auditor Note: Systematically check for uses of `unwrap_or_else` or `unwrap_or` on environment variables representing secrets or credentials, ensuring they fail securely rather than supplying weak default fallbacks.
